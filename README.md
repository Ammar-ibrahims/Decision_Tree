#Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree
This repository contains an implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm as part of my machine learning studies. It includes simple Decision Tree model, along with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project serves as a foundational step in understanding and applying supervised learning techniques.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
